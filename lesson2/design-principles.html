            <p>
                For this website I chose the principles of white space,  and contrast. The reason for that Odd Pears
                is able to recognize the bold designs and colors of their product and use white space as contrast to not overcrawd
                 their design with other colors, backgrounds and fonts. For this page white space is a great tool to balance 
                and better organize content to improve the visual communication experience. Also white space/background 
                is use as contrast to make their product stand out.

            <h3>Visual Hierachy</h3>
            <h4>Academy Sports + Outdoor </h4>

                <p>
                    Academy Sports Store has done a good job with visual Hierachy; as  the arrangmet of  elements 
                    to show their order of importance. If one pays notice on the picture,
                    they have more than one sale going on, the first one is more eye cahtching; wchis is a the top of the screen 
                    with color background and bold dramatic font. Then, the second sale which, 
                    is where the hierachy come into play,not only is placed lower on the screen. The font while still in color 
                    is less dramatic, more even in sized with a white background.

                <h3> Fitts Law</h3>
                <h4> OshKosh B'gosh</h4>

                    <img src="images/OKB.jpg" alt="OshkoshBgosh mobile screenshot">
                    <p>
                        What I like about Fitts Law is the application to the user experience and the "ease of use" to get to
                        a targeted area or information of the webpage. In the case of OKB, Fitts Law is exemplifided 
                        in the use of buttons with each of the categories of the clothes sizes they have. I liked the part on where
                        Fitts Law states that the longer the distance the harded is to make a desition. in this case you dont have to spend
                        extra time searching among all their inventory to find a size.The faster you get there, the higer the chances of making a purchase.
