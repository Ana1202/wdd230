                     <p>
                        The two personas that as a chamber of commerce would target could be divided in to two. The first persona is: Business owner and entrepreneurs, as a chamber of commerce we would strive to get membership of as many business as possible. The second persona would aim to target the community, for they are who truly move the economy and the business around town.

                    <h3 > PERSONA ONE</h3>
                        <p>
                        The first persona of target audience is business owners and entrepreneurs. Because, of the goal to be able to create a group made by business owners for business owners with the purpose of having willingness to receive and provide support to other business, as well as promote their own while protecting their assets. We want to be able to create a space where business can reach the community while breaking the barrier and ease obstacles of growth.  The Chamber of commerce main source of income relies on membership fees, therefore, we want to be able to target big corporations as well as small local mom-and-pop- business. We would be able to provide different levels of membership within the chamber and in exchange, business will receive different benefits.

                <h3 >PERSONA TWO</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The second part of my target Audience is the community, meaning the potential customers to all the members of the chamber. To me, this is a two-part equation with a common result, since business cannot grow without customers, we serve as the connection to bring success to the business and as result the community thrives. As a target audience part of the chamber, it to be dedicated to communicate what the business and organizations are doing to serve the community. As well as organize opportunities for members of the chamber to serve and connect with the community via fundraises, community events etc.
