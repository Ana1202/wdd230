                     <p>
                    The two personas that as a chamber of commerce would target could be divided in to two. The first persona is: 
                    Bussiness owner and entrepreneurs, as a chamber of commerce we would trive to get membership of as many business as possible.
                    The second persona would aim to target the comunity, for they are who truly move the economy and .

                    <h3 id=> PERSONA ONE</h3>
                        <p>
                    The first persona of target audience is business owners and entrepenours. Because, of the goal to 
                    be able to create a group made by bussinees owners for bussiness owners with the purpose of having  willingness to 
                    recive and provide support to other business, as well as promote their own while protecting their assets. We want to be able to 
                    create a space where business can reach the comunity while breaking the barrier and ease obstacles of growth.
                    The Chamber of commerce main source of income relys on membership fees,  Therefore, we want to be able to target big corporations
                    as well as small local mom-and-pop- business. We would be able to provide different levels of membership within the chamber and in exchange 
                    business will recieve differentbenefits.

                <h3 >PERSONA TWO</h3>
                    <p> 
                    The second part of my target Audience is the comunity, meaning the potential customers to all the menbers of the chamber.
                    to me this is a two part equation with a common result, since business cannot grow without customers, we serve as the connection to bring success
                    to the bussiness and as result the community thrives. As a target audience part of the chamber it to be dedicated to cominicate what the business and 
                    organizations are doing to serve the comunity. As well as organize opportunities  for members of the chamber to serve and connect with the comunity 
                    via fundraises, comunity events etc.
