            <p>
                For this website I chose the principles of white space, and contrast. The reason for that Odd Pears can recognize the bold designs and colors of their product and use white space as contrast to not over crowd their design with other colors, backgrounds, and fonts. For this page white space is a great tool to balance and better organize content to improve the visual communication experience. Also, white space/background is use as contrast to highlight their product and make it stand out.

                    Academy Sports Store has done a good job with visual Hierarchy as the arrangement of elements to show their order of importance. If one pays notice on the picture, they have more than one sale going on, the first one is more eye catching, which is a the top of the screen with color background and bold dramatic font. Then, the second sale which, is where the hierarchy comes into play, not only is placed lower on the screen. The font while still in color is less dramatic, more even in sized with a white background.

                        What I like about Fitts Law is the application to the user experience and the "ease of use" to get a targeted area or information of the webpage. In the case of OKB, Fitts Law is exemplified in the use of buttons with each of the categories of the clothes sizes they have. I liked the part on where Fitts Law states that the longer the distance the harder is to make a decision. For this case you donâ€™t have to spend extra time searching among all their inventory to find a size. The faster you get there, the higher the chances of making a purchase.
